# self-intro


Hello, my name is Olga and I am happy to be a student of Rolling Scopes school. 
Originally I am from Saint-Petersburg Russia, but a few years ago I moved to London to continue my study here. 
In Saint-Petersburg  I used to work on the Echo of Moscow radio station in the commercial department, I truly loved this work,
especially the part when I  had to work with sound engineers and actors. Unfortunately, I had to quit this job,
because it was not possible to curry on to do it remotely. 
In London I tried a variety of jobs, but could never find the right  mix of technologies and creativity, which I always wanted.
Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic,  I have been given tons of free time and I decided to rethink my career path.
I have always been interested in the tech industry, so I decided to try myself as a frontend developer. 
I had zero understanding of how to start, so I enrolled  in my first course. First I started  the  course of HTML Academy
and then I found information about this course in the HTML academy chat. Other students describe it as highly challenging, but very interesting. 
So, I could not resist ))  
Within the last few months, I have been learning how to use Git, work with Commander, and have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I have built three simple websites. The first one helps to find hotels in one of the national parks in the US. The second is the online store 
adapted for a laptop, tablet, and mobile. The last one is the single page application, which helps to find hotels on the map.
Now I'm working on a website that helps travelers plan their routes. Please, check my work on GitHub elismountain.
Thank you very much for your time.
